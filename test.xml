<para style="s0">This book is the account about Jonah, when he disobeyed God, was three days in a big fish\'s belly, and finally went to warn the wicked people in Nineveh city that God was going to destroy them. We call this book JONAH.</para>

<verse number="1" style="v" sid="Jon 1:1" />
<char style="add"> One day</char> Yahweh said to the <char style="add">prophet</char> Jonah, Amittai's son, 
<verse number="1" eid="Jon 1:1" />
<verse number="2" style="v" sid="Jon 1:2" />
 "I have seen how wicked are <char style="add">the people who live in</char> the great city called Nineveh. Therefore, go there and warn the people that I am planning to destroy their city because they d sinned."
<verse number="2" eid="Jon 1:2" />

<verse number="3" style="v" sid="Jon 1:3" />
 But <char style="add">Jonah</char> did not go <char style="add">to Nineveh</char>. <char style="add">Instead, he</char> went in the direction opposite to where Yahweh told him to go. He went (down) to Joppa <char style="add">city</char>. There he paid the fare to travel on a ship that was going to Tarshish <char style="add">city</char>. Jonah wanted to escape from Yahweh and avoid doing what Yahweh had told him to do. He got on the ship, <char style="add">and then he went down to a lower deck inside the ship. He lay down, and went to sleep.</char>
<verse number="3" eid="Jon 1:3" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="4" style="v" sid="Jon 1:4" />
 Then Yahweh caused a very strong wind to blow. There was such a violent storm that <char style="add">the sailors thought</char> the ship would break apart. 
<verse number="4" eid="Jon 1:4" />
<verse number="5" style="v" sid="Jon 1:5" />
 The sailors were very frightened. So, they each started to pray to their own gods <char style="add">to save them</char>. Then they threw the cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter <char style="add">in order that it would not sink easily</char>.
<verse number="5" eid="Jon 1:5" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="6" style="v" sid="Jon 1:6" />
 Then the captain went <char style="add">down</char> to where Jonah was sleeping deeply. He <char style="add">awoke him and</char> said to him. "You should not be sleeping <char style="add">during a storm like this one!</char> Get up and pray to your god! Perhaps he will pity us and save us, so that we will not drown!" 
<verse number="6" eid="Jon 1:6" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="7" style="v" sid="Jon 1:7" />
 Then the sailors said to each other, "We must cast lots to determine who has caused all this trouble!" So they did that, and the lots showed that Jonah had caused the storm. 
<verse number="7" eid="Jon 1:7" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="8" style="v" sid="Jon 1:8" />
 So <char style="add">various ones among</char> them asked Jonah, "Are you the one who has caused all this trouble for us?" "What work do you do?" "Where are you coming from?" "What country and what people-group do you belong to?"
<verse number="8" eid="Jon 1:8" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="9" style="v" sid="Jon 1:9" />
 Jonah replied, "I am a Hebrew. I worship Yahweh, who lives in heaven. He is the God who made the sea and the land. I am trying to escape from <char style="add">doing what</char> Yahweh <char style="add">told me to do</char>."
<verse number="9" eid="Jon 1:9" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="10" style="v" sid="Jon 1:10" />
 After/When the sailors heard that, they were <char style="add">more</char> terrified. So, they asked him, "Do you realize what trouble you have caused?"
<verse number="10" eid="Jon 1:10" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="11" style="v" sid="Jon 1:11" />
 The storm kept getting worse, and the waves kept getting bigger. So, one sailor among them asked Jonah, "What must we do <char style="add">to you, so that your god</char> will make the sea become calm?"
<verse number="11" eid="Jon 1:11" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="12" style="v" sid="Jon 1:12" />
 Jonah replied to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea. <char style="add">If you do that,</char> then the sea will become calm. I know that this terrible storm is caused by my <char style="add">not doing what Yahweh told me to do</char>."
<verse number="12" eid="Jon 1:12" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="13" style="v" sid="Jon 1:13" />
 But the sailors <char style="add">did not want to do that. Instead,</char> they tried hard to row the ship back to land. But <char style="add">they could not do so, because</char> the storm continued to get worse.
<verse number="13" eid="Jon 1:13" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="14" style="v" sid="Jon 1:14" />
 Therefore, the sailors prayed to Yahweh, "O Yahweh, please do not cause us to drown after we cause this man to die. O Yahweh, we beg you, do not consider us to be guilty when we cause this man to die. We know that you have sent this storm for your own good reasons."
<verse number="14" eid="Jon 1:14" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="15" style="v" sid="Jon 1:15" />
 Then they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea. Then the sea became calm. 
<verse number="15" eid="Jon 1:15" />
<verse number="16" style="v" sid="Jon 1:16" />
 When that happened, the sailors became greatly awed at/respected Yahweh's power. So, they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh. They also vowed to him that they would do things that would please him.

<para style="p">
<verse number="17" style="v" sid="Jon 1:17" />
<char style="add"> While they were doing that,</char> Yahweh sent a huge fish that swallowed Jonah. Then Jonah was inside the fish's belly for three days and three nights.

<verse number="1" style="v" sid="Jon 2:1" />
 While Jonah was inside the huge fish, he prayed to Yahweh God, <char style="add">whom he worshiped</char>. <char style="add">This is what Jonah reported later:</char>
<verse number="1" eid="Jon 2:1" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="2" style="v" sid="Jon 2:2" />
 Jonah said, "Yahweh, when I was greatly distressed there <char style="add">in the fish belly</char>, I prayed to you, and you heard what I prayed. When I was about to descend way down into the place where dead people go, you heard me when I called out for you to help/save me. 
<verse number="2" eid="Jon 2:2" />
<verse number="3" style="v" sid="Jon 2:3" />
 You threw me down into the deep water, down to the sea's bottom. The sea currents swirled around me, and the huge waves crashed above me. 
<verse number="3" eid="Jon 2:3" />
<verse number="4" style="v" sid="Jon 2:4" />
 Then I thought/said, 'Although You have banished me, Yet I will go to see your holy temple again!'

 "The water surrounded me, and threatened to drown me. Seaweed was wrapped around my head. 
<verse number="5" eid="Jon 2:5" />
<verse number="6" style="v" sid="Jon 2:6" />
 I sank down to where the mountains start rising from the sea bottom. I thought that it would be as though my body would forever be in a prison inside the earth below me. But you, Yahweh God, whom I worship, you rescued me from going down to the place where the dead go. 
<verse number="6" eid="Jon 2:6" />
<verse number="7" style="v" sid="Jon 2:7" />
 When I was almost dead, Yahweh, I thought about you. You heard my prayer <char style="add">to you</char>, up there where you are, in your holy temple. 
<verse number="7" eid="Jon 2:7" />
<verse number="8" style="v" sid="Jon 2:8" />
 All those who worship worthless idols are rejecting you, the one who could act kindly toward them. 
<verse number="8" eid="Jon 2:8" />
<verse number="9" style="v" sid="Jon 2:9" />
 But I will sing to thank you, and I will offer a sacrifice to thank you, Yahweh. I will surely do what I have solemnly promised to do. Yahweh, you are the only one who is able to save us."

<para style="s3">The people in Nineveh repented after Jonah warned them</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="1" style="v" sid="Jon 3:1" />
 Then Yahweh said to Jonah a second time, saying, 
<verse number="1" eid="Jon 3:1" />
<verse number="2" style="v" sid="Jon 3:2" />
 "Go immediately to that great city called Nineveh, and tell the people who live there the message that I gave you <char style="add">previously</char>."

</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="3" style="v" sid="Jon 3:3" />
 So, <char style="add">this time</char> Jonah obeyed Yahweh, and he went to Nineveh. That city was so big that <char style="add">a person</char> <char style="add">had to walk</char> for three days to <char style="add">go</char> <char style="add">everywhere in</char> it.
<verse number="3" eid="Jon 3:3" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="4" style="v" sid="Jon 3:4" />
 On the first day <char style="add">after</char> Jonah <char style="add">arrived</char>, he <char style="add">began walking</char> through the city. He started proclaiming to the people, "Forty days from now, <char style="add">God</char> will destroy Nineveh!" 
<verse number="4" eid="Jon 3:4" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="5" style="v" sid="Jon 3:5" />
 The people in Nineveh believed God's <char style="add">message</char>. They <char style="add">all</char> decided that everyone should stop eating food, and they must dress themselves with old/rough clothes, <char style="add">to show that they were sorry for having sinned</char>.  So, <char style="add">everyone</char>, including important people and unimportant people, <char style="add">did so</char>.
<verse number="5" eid="Jon 3:5" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="6" style="v" sid="Jon 3:6" />
 Nineveh's king heard the news about Jonah and <char style="add">what the people were doing</char>. <char style="add">So,</char> he took off his royal robes, and <char style="add">he also</char> put on old/rough clothes. He left his palace, and sat down on <char style="add">cold</char> ashes, <char style="add">to humble himself and show that he also was sorry for having sinned</char>. 
<verse number="6" eid="Jon 3:6" />
<verse number="7" style="v" sid="Jon 3:7" />
 Then he sent messengers to proclaim to <char style="add">everyone in</char> Nineveh:
<verse number="7" eid="Jon 3:7" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="7" style="v" sid="Jon 3:7" />
 "My advisors and I have decreed that no one may eat or drink anything. Do not even allow your animals to eat or drink. 
<verse number="7" eid="Jon 3:7" />
<verse number="8" style="v" sid="Jon 3:8" />
 Instead, every person must put on old/rough cloth. <char style="add">Put old/rough cloth on</char> your animals, <char style="add">too</char>. Then everyone must pray fervently to God. And everyone must stop doing evil actions/things, and stop acting violently <char style="add">toward others</char>. 
<verse number="8" eid="Jon 3:8" />
<verse number="9" style="v" sid="Jon 3:9" />
 Perhaps, <char style="add">if everyone does so</char>, then God may change his mind and be merciful <char style="add">to</char> us.  Maybe God will stop being very angry with us, with the result that we will not die."
<verse number="9" eid="Jon 3:9" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="10" style="v" sid="Jon 3:10" />
 When they <char style="add">all did that</char>, God saw what they were doing, and he saw that they had stopped doing evil things. So, <char style="add">he pitied them, and</char> he did not destroy them as he had threatened to do. 
<verse number="10" eid="Jon 3:10" />

<chapter number="4" style="c" sid="Jon 4" />
<para style="s4">Yahweh teaches Jonah that he has/shows mercy and compassion</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="1" style="v" sid="Jon 4:1" />
 But when Yahweh did not punish Nineveh, this distressed/displeased Jonah very much! And he became very angry. <char style="add">(The people in Nineveh were not Jews, and Jonah did not think that God should act mercifully toward people who were enemies to the Jews.)</char>
<verse number="1" eid="Jon 4:1" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="2" style="v" sid="Jon 4:2" />
 So, Jonah complained to Yahweh, saying: "O Yahweh, what you have done is what I thought that you would do, before I left home. That is why I <char style="add">decided</char> immediately to run away, and go to Tarshish <char style="add">city</char>. I did so because I knew that you, O God, act very kindly and compassionate <char style="add">toward all people</char>. You do not quickly become angry with people who do evil things. You love people very much, and you change your mind about punishing <char style="add">sinful</char> <char style="add">people</char> <char style="add">when they repent</char>. 
<verse number="2" eid="Jon 4:2" />
<verse number="3" style="v" sid="Jon 4:3" />
 So, now, O Yahweh, <char style="add">because you will not destroy Nineveh city as you said you would,</char> allow me to die. It is better for me to die than to <char style="add">continue to</char> live."
<verse number="3" eid="Jon 4:3" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="4" style="v" sid="Jon 4:4" />
 Yahweh replied, "Why are you angry <char style="add">that I have not destroyed the city</char>?"
<verse number="4" eid="Jon 4:4" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="5" style="v" sid="Jon 4:5" />
 Jonah <char style="add">did not reply</char>. He went out from the city to its east <char style="add">side</char>. He made a small shelter so that he could sit under it and be protected from the sun. He sat under the shelter and waited to see what would happen to the city.
<verse number="5" eid="Jon 4:5" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="6" style="v" sid="Jon 4:6" />
 Then Yahweh God caused a vine to grow up <char style="add">immediately</char> to shade Jonah's head from the sun and make him <char style="add">feel</char> more comfortable. Jonah was very happy about <char style="add">having</char> the vine <char style="add">over his head</char>. 
<verse number="6" eid="Jon 4:6" />
<verse number="7" style="v" sid="Jon 4:7" />
 But before dawn the next day, God sent a worm that chewed the vine, with the result that the vine withered. 
<verse number="7" eid="Jon 4:7" />
<verse number="8" style="v" sid="Jon 4:8" />
 Then, when the sun rose <char style="add">high in the sky</char>, God sent a very hot wind from the east. The sun shone very strongly on Jonah's head, with the result that he felt faint. He wanted to die, and he said, "It would be better for me to die than to <char style="add">continue to</char> live!"
<verse number="8" eid="Jon 4:8" />
</para>
<para style="p">
<verse number="9" style="v" sid="Jon 4:9" />
 But God asked Jonah, "Is it right/good for you to be angry <char style="add">because the vine died</char>?"
<verse number="9" eid="Jon 4:9" />
</para>
<verse number="10" style="v" sid="Jon 4:10" />
 But Yahweh said <char style="add">to him</char>, "You feel sorry about my <char style="add">causing</char> that vine <char style="add">to wither</char>, even though you did not make it grow and you did not care for it. It just grew up during one night, and it completely withered during the next night. 
<verse number="10" eid="Jon 4:10" />
<verse number="11" style="v" sid="Jon 4:11" />
 But there are more than 120,000 people in Nineveh who do not know right from wrong <char style="add">(and they are more valuable than that vine)</char>. There are also many animals/livestock/cows <char style="add">in Nineveh</char>. So, it is right for me to show compassion to the people who live in that huge city <char style="add">and not want to destroy them!</char>"
